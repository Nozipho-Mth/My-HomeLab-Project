🐧 Step-by-Step: Launching an Ubuntu EC2 Instance on AWS Free Tier
  🛠️ Prerequisites:
        At this point you already have an AWS Free Tier account
        You're in the EC2 Dashboard
        Your key pair (e.g., .pem file) is downloaded and saved
        You've set up IAM users/roles, cost alarms, and basic security groups

🚀 Step 1: Launch a New EC2 Instance
    Go to EC2 Dashboard → click "Launch Instance"
    Name your instance (e.g., Ubuntu-VM)
    Under Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
      -Select Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type
      -Eligible for Free Tier

💻 Step 2: Choose an Instance Type
    Choose t2.micro (free tier eligible)
    Click Next or Configure Instance

🔐 Step 3: Configure Key Pair
    Under Key pair, select your existing key (e.g., Myhomelabproject.pem)
    If not created, click “Create new key pair,” download and store it safely

🌐 Step 4: Configure Network Settings
    Create or select a Security Group:
    Allow:
      -SSH (port 22) — your IP only
      -Optional: HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443) for web testing

💾 Step 5: Add Storage (Optional)
    Default: 8 GiB (general purpose SSD)
    Leave as is unless you need more space

✅ Step 6: Review and Launch
    Review everything
    Click Launch Instance

⌛ Step 7: Wait and Connect
      -Once it's running:
      -Go to Instances
      -Select your Ubuntu VM
      -Copy the Public IPv4 DNS

🔗 Step 8: Connect via MobaXterm
In MobaXterm:

ssh -i "C:/Users/yourname/Downloads/Myhomelabproject.pem" ubuntu@<your-public-ip>
    -Username for Ubuntu is ubuntu
    -Accept the fingerprint

You’re in! 🎉

🛡️ Step 9: Update & Secure Ubuntu
Once inside your VM, run:
    -sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Optional tools you can install for practice:
    -sudo apt install nmap hydra net-tools curl -y (I played a bit on hydra, I'll be share more details at a later stage during my learning journey)
