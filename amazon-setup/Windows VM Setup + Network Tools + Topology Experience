🪟 Windows VM Setup + Network Tools + Topology Experience

✅ Launching Windows VM on AWS
    Go to your AWS EC2 Dashboard.
    Click Launch Instance.
    Under Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
      -Search for Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Base or similar.
    Choose a t2.micro instance (eligible for Free Tier).
    Create or select a key pair (for RDP access).
    Configure Security Group:
      -Allow RDP (port 3389) for your IP only (highly recommended).
    Launch the instance and download the RDP file.

🔐 Accessing the VM
    Go to EC2 > Instances.
    Select your Windows instance → Connect > RDP client.
    Use the RDP file + decrypted password to log in.

🛠️ Installing Tools on Windows VM
    Nmap
      -Download from: https://nmap.org/download.html
      -Choose the Windows Installer.
      -Run as Administrator after install.

    Wireshark
      -Download from: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
      -Install with Npcap for packet capturing.
      -Launch Wireshark and filter traffic using basic filters like:
        http
        ip.addr == your.ip.here

🌐 Network Topology Experience
  🔍 Basic Topology Test
      Create 2–3 EC2 instances (Linux + Windows) and place them in the same VPC and Subnet.
      Try pinging between machines using command prompt or PowerShell.
      Test port connectivity using:

nmap -p 80,443 <other-instance-IP>

🌍 HTTP Scanning
    On your Windows VM, open PowerShell or CMD.

Run a basic scan with Nmap:
    nmap -sS -p 80,443 <target-ip>
Optionally, install a small web server on one Linux VM to simulate a test environment.
Use Wireshark to inspect HTTP traffic if allowed.

🧠 Notes & Security Tips
    📌 Keep your security groups tight – allow only your IP to access the VM.
    🕐 Stop the instance when not in use to avoid wasting your free-tier hours.
    🔐 Set up Cost Alarms + MFA for your AWS account.
    💡 Consider using Windows Defender Firewall rules to test inbound/outbound traffic behavior.
